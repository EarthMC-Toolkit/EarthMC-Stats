The most popular Discord bot for **EarthMC** is now open source!

**EarthMC Stats** provides useful commands and info relating to players, towns, nations, alliances and more.
This bot relies heavily on the purpose-made [NPM Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/earthmc) which handles the parsing and caching of map data automatically.

> [!NOTE]
> - Duplicate code is slowly being phased out in favour of helper classes found in the `common` folder.
> - To reduce reads/writes, an in-memory cache is used alongside [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) - no PR's should edit this.

## Features
âœ… Written in **TypeScript** for type-safety and intellisense.<br>
âœ… Uses modern **ESM** format which provides a nicer syntax and better module compatibility.<br>
âœ… **DiscordJS** commands and events have their own files for clarity and maintainability.<br>
âœ… **Firestore** database is used, allowing EMCS to be used seamlessly when EarthMC goes down.<br>
âœ… Fast responses via an in-memory cache and fast HTTP client thanks to [Undici](https://undici.nodejs.org/#/?id=undicirequesturl-options-promise).
