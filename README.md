The most popular Discord bot for **EarthMC** is now open source!

**EarthMC Stats** provides useful commands and info relating to players, towns, nations, alliances and more.<br>
This bot relies heavily on the purpose-made [NPM Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/earthmc) which handles the parsing and caching of map data automatically.

## Notes
- Duplicated code is slowly being phased out in favour of helper classes found in the `common` folder.
- To reduce reads/writes, an in-memory cache is used alongside [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) - please don't mess with this.
- This repo is meant for viewing and attribution, hosting it yourself will **NOT** work.

## Features
✅ Written in **TypeScript** for type-safety and intellisense.<br>
✅ Uses modern **ESM** format which provides a nicer syntax and better module compatibility.<br>
✅ **DiscordJS** commands and events have their own files for clarity and maintainability.<br>
✅ **Firestore** database is used, allowing EMCS to be used seamlessly when EarthMC goes down.<br>
✅ Fast responses via an in-memory cache and fast HTTP client thanks to [Undici](https://undici.nodejs.org/#/?id=undicirequesturl-options-promise).
